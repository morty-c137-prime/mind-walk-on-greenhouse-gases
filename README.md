## Greenhouse Gases


### Why have chosen to write?
There comes a point in every students life where they have decided on an efficient work flow, a consistent style of writing, and maybe most importantly a grasp of the ways they learn best. In an attempt to reach student Nirvana, I am going to explore the space of writing/documenting as a means of learning. One might draw parallels to note taking, but I plan to write in the space between a formal write-up and a table napkin note.  

*(Disclaimer: This paper will be ridden grammatical, logical, and scientific error. This is not because I am a bad student or a bad person, this is because I am learning. I will not delete anything, but ideas will be marked as incorrect or as no longer mine. As well as being marked, they will be linked to a later entry where I clear my mistake.)*

### 1,000 ft. View<sup>[1 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTvqIijqvTg)[2](http://environ.andrew.cmu.edu/m3/s2/02sun.shtml)</sup>
A quick Google search landed me a Youtube video. 

> The moon and earth are relatively the same distance from the sun. However, the temperatures of the moon are much hotter during the day and much cooler at night compared to the Earth. 

Why? Earth's atmosphere acts like a blanket. During the day it protects us from (highly energetic intense sun rays?) and during the night traps the infrared radiation (heat). It does this by reflecting solar energy that can harm life (UV rays) and allowing heat to get through and then keeping some of it in (Greenhouse effect).

At this point I dropped the last video, it wasn't consistent with its jargon. I did watch it though. It got me thinking about the sun, and "solar radiation." The next source I found came from another Google search looking for a formal definition of solar energy. I wanna pick out some really great quotes that helped me grok the sun.  

> While the sun does emit ultraviolet radiation, the majority of solar energy comes in the form of "light" and "heat," in the visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

> The range of electromagnetic energy emitted by the sun is known as the solar spectrum, and lies mainly in three regions: ultraviolet, visible, and infrared.   

> The term "radiation" simply denotes the fact that the energy travels as rays  

Wow this turned out to be much more useful! The next two pages go over the composition of Earth's atmosphere and how it interacts with solar energy.

### The Earth's Atmosphere<sup>[3](http://environ.andrew.cmu.edu/m3/s2/03earthatmos.shtml)</sup>
The Earth's atmosphere is composed of five layers each composed of unique medleys of molecules. Earth's mass exerts a large gravitational pull that keeps these layers around it.  

![Diagram of Earth's Atmosphere](http://environ.andrew.cmu.edu/m3/s2/graphics/embedded/fig7.gif)

The first layer of the atmosphere absorbs the high frequency energy from the sun. Because the stream of particles from the Sun and space are charged, they interact with Earth's poles and travel toward the North or South pole depending on their charge. Molecules of O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> at the top of the atmosphere absorb high frequency radiation and are stripped of their electron and turn into their ions.

> ...10 nm to about 350 nm is the ultraviolet region. The absorption spectrum of the ozone molecules is from 240 to 300 nm, while the O2 molecule absorbs wavelengths shorter than 175 nm (splitting into O atoms). This absorption of the O3 and O2 molecules is the basis of the ozone layer.

The main molecules involved in Earth's atmosphere are Oxygen, and Nitrogen. Carbon dioxide, Nitrogen Oxide and Ozone are produced in low quantities *naturally*. Each is produced differently. 

> Methane arises from natural processes such as cows and paddy fields  

> H2O and CO2 are essential molecules for photosynthesis. H2O and CO2 are also central in moderating the temperature of the atmosphere as the Earth rotates.  

> Water is the most highly variable gas in the atmosphere. The water fraction in the atmosphere (measured by the relative humidity) varies from place to place and day to day.  

>Carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, NO, NO2, and more complex nitrogen compounds are formed as a byproduct of the operation of the internal combustion engine and other fossil fuel-based technologies.   

### The Earth, The Sun, and Your Car<sup>[4](http://environ.andrew.cmu.edu/m3/s2/04solarad.shtml)</sup>
As solar radiation enters the Atmosphere different molecules reflect harmful UV light and reflect thermal and visible light. This is what I was writing about earlier as the atmosphere acts as shield against radiation. Electromagnetic waves need to be pushed around my charged particles. A lot of the molecules in our atmosphere do not have a charge, they are balanced between electrons and neutrons. However I know that some molecules are polar and the electrons are on one side of the molecule. This makes polar molecules like H<sub>2</sub>O can absorb infrared rays. CO<sub>2</sub> particles reflect radiation as well even though they are not polar and its because in the atmosphere as gases they are constantly crashing with other CO<sub>2</sub> and it allows them to reflect Electromagnetic waves.

> The atmosphere controls the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface of the earth, and regulates the amount of radiation from the Earth escaping into space. Even seemingly slight changes in the concentrations of certain gases could upset the balance of reactions and be detrimental to life as we know it. We will now explain these two exchanges in detail, and later discuss their relevance to two major environmental problems: global climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion.
